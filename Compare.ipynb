Open access is not an attempt to replace or undermine conventional publishers, but rather to advance the interests of research, researchers, and research institutions. Many conventional publishers are adapting to open access by allowing author-initiated OA, providing some OA themselves, or experimenting with OA. Open access doesn't require boycotting any kind of literature or publisher, and it doesn't primarily focus on bringing access to lay readers. Instead, it focuses on bringing access to professional researchers whose careers depend on access.\"}\n",
